    /*
        The Assignment Operator
        In JavaScript, the equal sign (=) is an "assignment" operator, not an "equal to" operator. This is different from algebra. The following does not make sense in algebra:
        x = x + 5
        In JavaScript, however, it makes perfect sense: it assigns the value of x + 5 to x.
        (It calculates the value of x + 5 and puts the result into x. The value of x is incremented by 5.)
