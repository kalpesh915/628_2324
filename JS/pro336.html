        The Break Statement
        You have already seen the break statement used in an earlier chapter of this tutorial. It was used to "jump out" of a switch() statement.
        The break statement can also be used to jump out of a loop:
    */

    for(let i = 1; i<= 10; i++){
        if(i == 5){
            break;
        }
        document.write(" "+i);
    }
