        JavaScript Uses 32 bits Bitwise Operands
        JavaScript stores numbers as 64 bits floating point numbers, but all bitwise operations are performed on 32 bits binary numbers.
        Before a bitwise operation is performed, JavaScript converts numbers to 32 bits signed integers.
        After the bitwise operation is performed, the result is converted back to 64 bits JavaScript numbers.

        JavaScript Bitwise AND
        When a bitwise AND is performed on a pair of bits, it returns 1 if both bits are 1.
