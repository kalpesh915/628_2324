        Function Declarations

        Earlier in this tutorial, you learned that functions are declared with the following syntax:
        function functionName(parameters) {
            // code to be executed
        }

        Declared functions are not executed immediately. They are "saved for later use", and will be executed later, when they are invoked (called upon).

        document.write("Today is "+Date());
    }

    msg();
