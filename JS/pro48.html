    /*
        JavaScript Identifiers
        All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names. These unique names are called identifiers. Identifiers can be short names (like x and y) or more descriptive names (age, sum, totalVolume).
        The general rules for constructing names for variables (unique identifiers) are:

        Names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs.
        Names must begin with a letter.
        Names can also begin with $ and _ (but we will not use it in this tutorial).
        Names are case sensitive (y and Y are different variables).
        Reserved words (like JavaScript keywords) cannot be used as names.

        
        Note : JavaScript identifiers are case-sensitive.
