        Note : It is considered good programming practice to always declare variables before use.
        From the examples you can guess:
        x stores the value 5, y stores the value 6, z stores the value 11

        Note : The var keyword was used in all JavaScript code from 1995 to 2015. The let and const keywords were added to JavaScript in 2015. The var keyword should only be used in code written for older browsers.
