        Function Return
        When JavaScript reaches a return statement, the function will stop executing.
        If the function was invoked from a statement, JavaScript will "return" to execute the code after the invoking statement. Functions often compute a return value. The return value is "returned" back to the "caller":
        
        Why Functions?
        With functions you can reuse code, You can write code that can be used many times. You can use the same code with different arguments, to produce different results.
