        Declaring a JavaScript Variable Creating a variable in JavaScript is called "declaring" a variable. You declare a JavaScript variable with the var or the let keyword:
        After the declaration, the variable has no value (technically it is undefined).
    */

    // let username = "Nisarg";

    let username; // declaration
    username = "Devarshi"; // To assign a value to the variable, use the equal sign:
    document.write("<hr>Welcome "+username);

    // Note : It's a good programming practice to declare all variables at the beginning of a script.
